   audit-ai-rules — the four standing AI-button rules, checked in CI-ish form.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   These rules are easy to satisfy once and lose later: a screen added next month
   filters an array without keeping its index, or renders a card head with no id, and
   rule 3 silently degrades back to the model guessing — which is exactly the bug
   that started this. Run with `npm run audit:ai`.

   Static checks only, so it is fast and needs no browser. It cannot prove the model
   behaves; it proves the CODE still offers the guarantees.

   The real Invoca page does not let a user rename the trigger, the conversation-start node

   ones generated later. The tree is derived at RENDER time with no schema slice and no
   engine phase, so that is true by construction today; these checks stop it drifting back.

   The failure being guarded against is specific and has happened once: the intent titles
   were derived from each prospect's routing queues (`voiceCopy`), so Shady Blinds read
   "Design Consultation / Existing Order" where the product always shows the same two words.

/* =============================================================================
   audit-ai-rules — the four standing AI-button rules, checked in CI-ish form.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   These rules are easy to satisfy once and lose later: a screen added next month
   filters an array without keeping its index, or renders a card head with no id, and
   rule 3 silently degrades back to the model guessing — which is exactly the bug
   that started this. Run with `npm run audit:ai`.

   Static checks only, so it is fast and needs no browser. It cannot prove the model
   behaves; it proves the CODE still offers the guarantees.
